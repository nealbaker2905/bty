This is best done by removing one or two branches a year, over a period of a few years, until the needed clearance is obtained. As the tree gets older, pruning every three to five years will keep the tree in good shape. As the tree gets larger, professional help may be required. Newly planted trees respond very well to fertilization.  · There are several young hackberry trees in our back yard which will shade our patio from the west sun. The trees will need to be pruned back away from the back of the house, so (1) what would be proper pruning and (2) if we have to remove a whole limb, how close to the trunk should the cut be (ie. flat against the trunk or leave a little stob) and do we use wound .  · Prune small, low-hanging, misshapen or broken branches that measure less than one inch in diameter. You should perform this type of pruning year-round. Make one clean cut outside of the swollen area where the branch meets the tree trunk, known as the branch collar. Remove large branches during the dormant period of late fall to early : Sophia Darby.
