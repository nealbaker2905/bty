 · In the heroic race, the pool is the maximum number of items available to collect at the very start of the mission. The pool always starts off full. Once you start emptying the pool, new items will fill the pool according to the wait time. You cannot collect any items if the pool is empty - you will have to wait for the pool to fill back up.  · Then you can feed this Terra Dragon up to Level 4 with just a small amount of food and you can collect the feed item with that. I normally have one spot in my habitats where I have this fresh Level 1 Terra Dragon ready to feed if I get that node in the heroic race – if I get the breeding node first I sell the the Level 1 dragon and fast breed a new Terra ted Reading Time: 4 mins.  · the lower the level of dragon the less food it costs - but it takes more luck to get items. I find powering up level 1 dragons to level 6 takes little food, but can give items. One thing I do outside of Heroic Races is leave all my newly aquired dragons at level 1 - and only power up dragons when the Heroic Race is on.
